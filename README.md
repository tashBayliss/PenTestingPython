Learning some useful Python Socket things 

## Learning socket
when creating a new socket
``` python
import sockets 
s = socket.socket (socket_family, socket_type, protocol = 0)
```

* socket_family − This is either AF_UNIX or AF_INET
    * AF_UNIX = the address family for Unix Domain Sockets (UDS), an interprocess communication protocol available on POSIX-compliant systems.
    * used to designate the type of addresses that your socket can communicate with (in this case, Internet Protocol v4 addresses)
    * domain = family of protocols used as the transport mechanism
* socket_type − This is either SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM
* protocol − This is usually left out, defaulting to 0.

## Socket Methods
### Server - provides service
* socket.bind() = binds the address(hostname,  port  number)  to the socket
* socket.listen() = listenstothe  connections  made  to  the socket. It starts TCP listener. Backlog is an argument of this method which specifies the  maximum  number  of  queued  connections.  Its  minimum  value  is  0  and maximum value is 5
* socket.accept() = This will accept TCP client connection. The pair (conn, address) is the return value pair of this method

### Client - requests to the server, receives services
* socket.connect(address) = creates a connection to a server

### General
* socket.recv(bufsize) = receives the TCP message from socket
    * The argument bufsize stands for buffer size and defines the maximum data this method can receive at any one time
* socket.send(bytes)
* socket.recvfrom(data,  address)
* socket.sendto(data,  address)
* socket.close()
* socket.gethostname()
* socket.sendall(data)
